# ðŸš€ AI-Assisted Threat Hunting Lab (Beginner Project)

This project explores how **AI (LLMs)** can assist in threat hunting by analyzing Windows logs and process trees.  
I set up a local lab using **Ollama + Mistral** on my Windows workstation, integrated **Sysmon & Security logs**, and generated AI-powered SOC-style summaries.

## ðŸ”Ž Phase 1 â€“ Proof of Concept (Completed)
- Installed Sysmon with SwiftOnSecurity config  
- Exported **Sysmon + Security logs** into text/JSON  
- Fed process trees into **Mistral (via Ollama)**  
- AI generated:  
  - Executive summary of suspicious activity  
  - MITRE ATT&CK mapping  
  - Extracted IOCs  
  - Severity rating

## ðŸ’¡ Key Learning
Even as a beginner, I saw how LLMs can:
- Save time in **initial triage**  
- Provide structured **incident summaries**  
- Highlight MITRE ATT&CK techniques automatically  

AI doesnâ€™t replace defenders â€” it **augments SOC analysts**.

## ðŸ“Œ Roadmap
**Phase 2 (Next):**
- Automate pipeline: Sysmon â†’ JSON â†’ Ollama â†’ Summary  
- Correlate across multiple log sources (DNS, Proxy, EDR)  
- Compare models (Mistral vs Gemma vs LLaMA)  

**Phase 3 (Future):**
- Integrate with **SIEM (Splunk/ELK)**  
- Enrich findings with **Threat Intel feeds**  
- Export **ATT&CK heatmaps**  
- Auto-populate incident tickets
