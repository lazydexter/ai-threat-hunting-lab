1. Summary: The infection chain starts with a user opening a malicious zip file (test.zip)
downloaded from abcxyz.site through Google Chrome. Upon opening, the zip file expands to
unzipped folder containing a JavaScript file (test.js). The JavaScript file then downloads and

saves a DLL file (test.dll) from malicious.site in the Temp directory. The DLL file is registered
as an ActiveX control using regsvr32.exe, and a scheduled task called &quot;Updater&quot; is created to
run the DLL daily at 9:00 AM. The final process svchost.exe might be part of the malware&#39;s
persistence mechanism.

2. Suspicious or Malicious Techniques:
- Execution via a web browser (Google Chrome)
- Use of compressed archives (test.zip) to hide malicious content
- Use of JavaScript to download and execute additional malicious files
- Registration of the DLL as an ActiveX control using regsvr32.exe
- Creation of a scheduled task for persistence

3. MITRE ATT&amp;CK Techniques:
- Initial Access: Exploitation of Web Browser (T1078)
- Execution: Command and Scripting Interpreter (T1059), Obfuscated Files or Information
(T1027)
- Persistence: Scheduled Task/Job (T1053)

4. Key IOCs:
- File Names: chrome.exe, cmd.exe, powershell.exe, wscript.exe, regsvr32.exe,
schtasks.exe, svchost.exe, test.zip, test.js, test.dll
- Domains: abcxyz.site, malicious.site
- IPs: Not specified in the provided process tree
- Registry Artifacts: C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Temp\test[.]dll
- Scheduled Tasks: &quot;Updater&quot;

5. Severity: High - This infection chain involves multiple evasion techniques, persistence
mechanisms, and the download of an unknown DLL file from a malicious domain, posing a
significant threat to the system and data.
